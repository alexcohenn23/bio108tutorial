# Tutorial for Data Science for Conservation Biology Course (`bio108tutorial`)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, which can also be opened and followed along in Google Colab. This series of files record the progression of my tutorial in this course (BIOL108). The week 7 (also updated in week 10) notebook explores and theorizes how deforestation may impact where threatened bird species are forced to reside and at what density. Additionally, it begins to explore how projected bioclimatic variables will affect dense populations of threatened bird species

The tutorial draft / final tutorial Jupyter Notebooks opt to expand upon an analysis by Sánchez‐Clavijo et al (2019) of Shade Coffee Land Cover as a habitat substitute for tropical forests for native bird species. Specifically, the tutorial incorporates statistical analysis to discover how birds in Magdelena, Colombia, interact with Shade Coffee environments compared to Tropical Forests over time. The ultimate goal of the tutorial is to discover how suitable Shade Coffee may be at conserving biodiversity as climate change and deforestation make tropical forests increasingly less successful at doing so.
